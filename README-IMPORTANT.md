I created a repository in Drive (/content/drive/MyDrive/CatsDogs) where I extracted and uploaded the dataset. 
Then, in the Data Preparation notebook, I created the pickled files of images (X.pickle) and labels (y.pickle) and stored them in the subfolder /content/drive/MyDrive/CatsDogs/Pickles . 

Repeat the same process in order to run the code. Otherwise, I made the repositories public, so you can just copy and paste the links of the pickles or the repository instead of creating one anew.

CatsDogs personal repository (with all the files) = https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wDN-xlK4YvsqEa0t2lLZ0RSpFJU55ahW?usp=share_link

X.pickle (pickle of the images) = https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ZQh_Ch7SwgSfBCw6TXOLgO8ZKgVxdS2/view?usp=share_link

y.pickle (pickle of the labels) = https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-b38kY0LIErEWYR6VvNmxBePEDfQeZhd/view?usp=share_link
